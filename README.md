# Newest Pastebin Paste
Extremely simple site that uses jQuery and AnyOrigin to pull the newest paste from Pastebin and display it. I'm using AnyOrigin here because I wanted to make this client-side, and Pastebin's API does not allow that.

I created this because when I'm bored I like to refresh Pastebin and look at the most recently posted paste; I wanted an easier way to do that.

This does require some type of web-server to run, because AnyOrigin doesn't allow anonymous requests. You could run this on a DropBox though for example.
